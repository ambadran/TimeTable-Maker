Welcome to the TimeTable making program,

Use start_tutorial(\x1B[3mmode\x1B[0m) function for help. There are two modes:

 - for interactive tutorial (step by step guide), pass 'interactive' as mode argument
 - for non-interactive tutorial (only text), pass 'text' as mode argument

First argument is the previously created timetable, second argument is a list of the names of the filters wanted
